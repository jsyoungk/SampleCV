# SampleCV
## Getting back into coding

<p>Feel free to check out the <a href="https://jsyoungk.github.io/SampleCV/index.html">Sample CV</a>.</p>
<p>This Sample CV is based off a class challenge from the Udemy Course: The Complete Web Development Course.
The challenge stipulated that we were to recreate a CV given to us: <a href="http://seanhalpin.io/">Sean Halpin</a>. 
Some of the difficulties of this challenge came from CSS position properties. I took the list of positions from the W3 School's website: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp </p>
<ul>
  <li>Static: Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow</li>
  <li>Absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element</li>
  <li>Fixed: The element is positioned relative to the browser window</li>
  <li>Relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position</li>
  <li>Sticky: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position</li>
  <li>Initial: Sets this property to its default value.</li>
  <li>Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>Another thing that I took for granted, and more or less ignored, was the <b>Auto</b> function. When you apply "auto" to a specified (width or height) on an object it will center it to it's parent container.The answer I found through stackoverflow summarized the functionality and usefulness of using auto: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3170772/what-does-auto-do-in-margin0-auto/3170774" > Using Auto</a>.</p>
<p>One gripe that I couldn't seem to figure out was how to align the favicon or profile icons to the sentences or words I put them next to.  I assume that the furhter I go through the Udemy program they'll explain it more indepth but so far I feel like I managed to recreate Sean Halpin's CV satisfactorialy. I also have a budding habit of not organizing my CSS and leaving in commented-out code in both CSS and HTML pages. So, to minimize it by being more succinct and using quick edits in the Console.</p>

<p>The images I used for the SampleCV specified that I need to give credit for using them. They all came from a site called <a href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flat Icon</a>. I'll link the specific pictures below and I also have them credited in the head of the index.html file.</p>

<p>The fonts that were used were from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. More specifically I used:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin">Libre Franklin for general usage</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway for the Headings</a></li>
 </ul> 
 
Lastly, the mountain and cloud images were included in the resource file for the Udemy classes.</p>
